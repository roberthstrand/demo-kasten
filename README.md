# Demo: Kasten running AKS
Code and content for a demonstration of [Kasten](https://www.kasten.io/), installed on Azure Kubernetes Service. Feel free to use any part of the codebase for your own deployment, if anything is of interest.

This is written as part of a practical demonstration for [Crayon](https://crayon.com). If you want to deploy Kasten in your environment, or have any other Kubernetes-related questions, you can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/roberthtweets) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberthstrand/).
